                        <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a
                            page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a
                            more-or-less normal distribution</p>
                        <h3><strong>1. Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.</strong></h3>
                        <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have
                            suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look
                            even slightly believable. </p>
                        <p>If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything
                            embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.</p>
                        <p>All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary,
                            making this the first true generator on the Internet.
                        </p>
                        <p>It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence
                            structures, <strong>generate Lorem Ipsum</strong> which looks reasonable. </p>
                        <h3><strong>2. Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</strong></h3>
                        <p>orem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
                            printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p>
                        <p>It has survived not only five centuries</p>
                        <p>but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
                            popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages
                        </p>
                        <p>and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of
                            Lorem Ipsum.

                        <p>It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over
